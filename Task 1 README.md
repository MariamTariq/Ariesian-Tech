## Data Profiling with ydata_profiling:
This project includes a Python script for generating a data profiling report using the ydata_profiling library. The profiling report provides an overview of the dataset, including statistics, distributions, and correlations, making it easier to understand the structure and quality of the data.
## Prerequisites:
The following Python packages needed to be installed:
**pandas**
**ydata_profiling**
I install these packages using pip:
***pip install pandas ydata-profiling***
## Code Explanation:
Here's a breakdown of the script:
***import pandas as pd***
***from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport***
## Imports:
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
ProfileReport from ydata_profiling is used to generate a detailed data profiling report.
***df = pd.read_csv('sub-division_population_of_pakistan.csv')***
***print(df)***
## Read CSV File:
This line reads a CSV file named sub-division_population_of_pakistan.csv into a Pandas DataFrame named df.
The print(df) statement outputs the contents of the DataFrame to the console, allowing you to see the data.
## Generate a report
***profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Subdivision population of Pakistan")***
## Generate Profile Report:
ProfileReport creates a profiling report of the DataFrame.
The title parameter sets the title of the report to "Subdivision population of Pakistan".
## Save report as HTML file
***profile.to_file("sub-division_population_of_pakistan.html")***
Save Report as HTML:
to_file method saves the generated report to an HTML file named sub-division_population_of_pakistan.html.
You can open this HTML file in a web browser to view the comprehensive data profiling report.
## Usage:
Place your CSV file (sub-division_population_of_pakistan.csv) in the same directory as this script.
Run the script to generate the data profiling report.
Open the resulting sub-division_population_of_pakistan.html file in a web browser to explore the report.
## Example
For a dataset on the subdivision population of Pakistan, the generated HTML report will include:
Overview statistics (mean, median, etc.)
Data distribution visualizations
Correlation matrices
Missing value information
And much more!
